# Next-agent handoff — 2026-11-05

Read this first, then the [implementation specification](architecture-and-training-plan.md)
and its linked topic owners. Older design-only status/authorization paragraphs
are historical. This handoff records measured mechanisms, not learned capability.

## Current checkpoint

The user then explicitly requested deletion of the old Muse framework. The
active local `muse-implementation` skill has been replaced with the cheap
single-call default; its four coordinator/runtime/tmux reference files and
reference symlink are deleted. The existing skill name/link still resolves.
Repository `AGENTS.md` now makes the same default persistent. See the
[removal receipt](evidence/muse-default-migration.json). Both generated batches,
raw responses, saved run scripts and pre-existing evidence were hash-checked
unchanged. No model call was made for this change. Historical launch scripts
must not be reused as the workflow. Further generation is not queued.

The user rejected the first batch's disproportionate generation overhead and
requested a fresh batch with cost saving. The replacement is complete in
`data/muse-economy-12/drafts/`: **12 drafts in one Muse completion**, no retries,
tools, children or reminders; 29.969 seconds, 16,293 input / 4,637 output tokens.
See [bounded-generation evidence](muse-economy-12.md). Fifteen model-free tests
pass; all twelve records pass draft validation and reject approved release.
Original response and explicit Codex syntax/content repairs are retained.
This batch is also unreviewed model-proposed development data, not a training
release. Prefer this bounded single-call workflow for small draft requests;
do not restart the rejected coordinator/worker/observer workflow. The old batch
and its evidence remain historical, unchanged. No further generation is queued.

Earlier, the user explicitly authorized Muse setup repair and **12 draft
scenarios**. This bounded batch is complete: two per domain, 17 source files,
all development/model_proposal, zero human reviews and no approvals. See the
[Muse draft report](muse-draft-pilot-2026-11-05.md) and
[portable evidence](evidence/muse-draft-pilot-v1-summary.json). Local data:
`data/muse-pilot-20261105T191615Z/drafts/`; open `review-inputs.md` before the separate
`outcome-proposals.md` for outcome-blind review. This user authorization does not
start bulk generation, capability fitting or deployment. Muse has exited cleanly
and all run-owned workers/commands/tmux resources are released.

Backend implementation slices are committed and pushed directly to `main`.
The [slice report](backend-slices-2026-11-05.md) records acceptance conditions,
results and limitations. No capability/reference fitting, bulk semantic data,
frontend integration or deployment was performed. The Operating Table and other
live services remain unchanged.

Latest continuation implementation commit: `4d96af1`; this handoff follows it.
The prior numeric/finite-guard evidence remains at `abd8dcf`, followed by the
original final handoff at `2da8e43`. The new
[release-boundary slices](backend-release-slices-2026-11-05.md) implement actual
source/annotation/review/approval byte checks, immutable release snapshots,
pilot/driver/sampler binding, exact resumed exposure cursors and a read-only
loader for the existing numeric evidence. No real reviewed pilot was created.

The original **324/324** v3 cases at 128/256/512 remain passed and were not rerun.
The separate **108/108** `v3-1024-v1` matrix passed in **5598.540981531143 s**:
one prefill/cache lineage, connected gradients, exact accounting, unchanged live
parameters and frozen/tied storage. Worst state RMS was 0, logit RMS
`3.12525587881255e-06`, and gradient RMS `3.848441887921371e-06`;
peak allocation was 13,093,139,968 bytes. See the
[1024 measured report](codec-1024-results-2026-11-05.md).

The matrix retains its exact source snapshot from before the subsequent finite
validation guards. Those guards reject overflow before clamp/argmax or dispatch;
finite arithmetic, weights, fixtures and tolerances are unchanged. The separate
post-guard 44-test GPU run passed. Neither result silently substitutes for the
other's source provenance.

The complete learned decision capability remains untrained/unpromoted. Prescribed
operations/statuses, diagnostic weights, fixed continuations and engineering
reference fixtures do not establish invocation, semantic understanding or answer
quality. The old BF16 transformer arithmetic still fails; do not relabel it.

## Preserve these requirements

- One human prompt, one prefill, one continuous hybrid cache and a normal answer
  from that same job. D for initial effort, R for native work, D for internally
  requested Noul/Choice/Score; no keyword/domain routing or second decision job.
- Textless typed requests/results, immutable bindings and selected contents.
  No derivative through argmax; task scalars and selected continuous contents
  retain connected gradients. Startup budget feedback alone is detached.
- Initial effort is continuous scalar regression in its own real LM-head row.
  Preserve the ordered CUDA FP64 S-curve `floor((3*s*s-2*s*s*s)*131072+0.5)`;
  context 262144, separate answer/thinking allowances, cancellation and closure.
- Qualified v3: BF16 frozen storage, FP32 transformer/LoRA computation and causal
  state, compensated BF16 vocabulary projection, genuine FP32 reference.
  Original BF16 transformer arithmetic remains a preserved failed profile.
- Model workloads only on RTX 3090 UUID
  `GPU-225509c3-d702-6c27-de03-76b5e99b33b1`. Never CPU/RTX3060 fallback. Driver
  access required execution outside the sandbox here; diagnose access/device
  selection before declaring GPU unavailable. Do not kill unrelated services.
- Keep The Operating Table's snapshot read-only and its services/artifacts intact.
  Diagnostic checkpoints must never replace live capability weights.
- Commit authorized work directly to `main` and push, per AGENTS.md. No PR/branch
  or repeated permission request is needed. Deployment needs separate authority.

## Completed slices and evidence

1. **Contract/code review and versioned qualification.** Direct implementing-agent
   review of codec/v3 and measured reports; no independent Astra approval claimed.
   The runner now distinguishes the 324-case `v3-512` protocol from the 108-case
   `v3-1024-v1` extension and rejects incomplete/duplicate/foreign/failed coverage.
   Direct review additionally found nonfinite Score clamping, gate acceptance
   and norm overflow. Pre-fix regressions reproduced the defects; finite guards
   now reject them, including terminating invalid gates without dispatch.
   No finite codec arithmetic, fixture statuses, reference or tolerances changed.
2. **F7 inputs/provenance.** Strict per-role/per-branch whitelists, transitive
   dependency checks, byte/hash/version/source coordinates, exposure flags,
   family/split and review-manifest gates. Current labels stay outside request
   encoders; non-assessed Reason has its own role/status exception. Mechanical
   checks cannot establish honest annotation or authenticate human reviews.
3. **F3 clean construction.** Fresh W+D derived source contexts; frozen W/reference
   semantic contexts; independent registries/local identities; complete clean
   packets through production rendering/admission; grounded exact kinds and
   absence/empty distinction. Parent hashes/coordinates remain external audit.
   Hidden-fact twins have identical complete request/return tensors. Unverified
   overlapping token offsets reject before encoding rather than being invented.
4. **Losses and optimization.** A4 subtype losses/masks, actual-snapshot binding,
   per-role semantic normalization, per-component CUDA VJPs/eligible-example
   denominators, eight scheduled exposures, one combined clip/step, unused
   `grad=None`, transactional rollback and named unique owners. Scalar rows are
   isolated. Tiny synthetic optimizer tests ran; real-model optimizer steps=0.
5. **Reference/live and scheduling.** Independent pooler/codec/T sharing frozen W;
   reference objective and frozen decoder preserve input gradients. Reference
   checkpoint replay reinstalls the scoped T mapping; reconstruction shares one
   frozen vocabulary slice per episode. Deterministic A4 sampler, replay recipes,
   prefix guidance, complete-session collection and guarded window driver exist.
6. **Export/resume.** Versioned small-weight bundles, actual reference tensor
   fingerprints, hashes, private effective rows, optimizer moments, phase/sampler/
   RNG state, strict v3/tied-W restore and exact next-update restoration tests.

Final focused GPU suite: **44/44 passed in 22.329 s**, comprising 18 existing
codec/precision, 6 finite-guard and 20 backend tests. Model-free: 10 input/provenance, 4 schedule, 2 matrix coverage and 6
existing exact codec tests pass. Exact commands/timings/log hashes are in the
[slice report](backend-slices-2026-11-05.md) and
[portable validation](evidence/backend-validation-2026-11-05.json).
Two concurrent reference-objective attempts hit GPU OOM; sharing the identical
vocabulary slice resolved the auxiliary retention defect and the affected GPU
suite passed. No numeric matrix restart, tolerance relaxation or CPU fallback.

Continuation validation: **42/42 model-free tests passed in 0.950 s**; after the
final numeric Boolean-marker guard, the **14/14 affected numeric/driver tests
passed in 0.312 s**. The new evidence loader separately validated the existing
108-case aggregate, three child reports and 28 archived source/test files.
Release/driver/qualification preflight imports no torch. These are metadata/schema
checks, not new GPU/model runs. Tests use explicit temporary schema fixtures;
their human/pass markers are never actual review or measured-model evidence.
Exact log/test source hashes are in the
[portable continuation validation](evidence/backend-release-validation-2026-11-05.json).

## Next unfinished slice / blockers

The replacement twelve pilot proposals now exist; do not regenerate them merely
because older handoffs reported no data. Obtain actual independent human reviews and
adjudicate/revise before approval or expansion. The existing full-pilot loader
requires authored roots, so admitting a reviewed model-proposed pilot needs an
explicit provenance-preserving policy reconciliation; never relabel these as
human-authored or fabricate review evidence. The batch covers 7/13 status cells,
and the full 120-case pilot remains incomplete. Generation usage/overhead is
recorded in the new report; assess it before scaling.

**Integrate a genuinely reviewed pilot release with task-specific episode
producers and semantic/promotion fixtures.** The driver accepts a complete-episode
producer; it is not a source of reviewed annotations or a complete trained flow.
The [release format](reviewed-release-format-v1.md) and read-only preflight now
exist, so this prerequisite needs actual reviewed files, not another hash-string
stub. Load both releases with `load_release`; construct the sampler using
`Sampler.from_release`. Joint `Driver` construction requires a loaded
`NumericEvidence`, supplied via `numeric=`, rather than a pass dictionary.
The G1 prerequisite remains an explicit caller attestation. Content hashes
establish bytes, not the identity/honesty of reviewers or semantic correctness.
No approved pilot, independent semantic reviews, subjective gold labels, trained
reference artifact or promotion evidence was fabricated. Follow data operations:
120 fictional scenarios, 20 in each of six domains, actual independent reviews
and adjudication, family splits before variants, no locked/design-exposed leakage.
Bulk generation and capability fitting require appropriate later authorization.

Independent implementation/interoperability review remains distinct from this
agent's direct review. Real reviewed clean Choice/Score/Reason semantic fixtures,
F8 coverage/denominators and reference recovery/contrast exits remain outstanding.
The new clean tests establish construction, not semantic correctness.

Before capability training, qualify the full A4 mix of actual participating
component buffers, optimizer moments and auxiliary graphs at applicable lengths.
The 1024 numeric matrix uses conservative memory envelopes, not a full trainer
memory/promotion certification. Run no automatic extra epochs, gold joint returns
or repairs based on locked-test outcomes. Keep frozen reference state independent
and carry live optimizer moments through later live phases.

Later work remains reference/components/guided/transition/free training in A4
order, final-two-checkpoint promotion, learned backend/frontend integration,
locked evaluation and separately authorized deployment. None is certified by
passing these engineering slices. Full context/maximum budget remain unqualified.

Missing pinned artifacts block model execution; do not download another model,
refit the diagnostic checkpoint or use CPU. The 1024 command is in its
[protocol](codec-1024-protocol-v1.md); always use a new output directory for an
affected rerun. No completed numeric matrix needs repeating for these docs.
